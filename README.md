# The Race and Stake Game

Race and Stake game is a phygital experience where users can buy physical RC cars after minting all NFT car upgrades. Players engage in a digital platform to collect parts, which upon completion, qualify them for a real-world item.
- Run `npm install`

## Legend

Let's create a Race and Stake. 
In the game Race and Stake, players can mint NFTs that represent racing cars. Each NFT starts with an empty recordâ€”no wins, no losses. 
## Car Upgrades

In the game Race and Stake, players can mint NFTs that represent car parts as upgrades. Each of these parts enhances the car's performance in races.

- **Body Kit Upgrade:** Enhances aerodynamics. ![Body Kit Upgrade](./images/body_kit_upgrade.png)
- **Engine Upgrade:** Boosts engine power. ![Engine Upgrade](./images/engine_upgrade.png)
- **Wheel Upgrade:** Improves traction and speed. ![Wheel Upgrade](./images/wheel_upgrade.png)
- **Booster Upgrade:** Provides a temporary speed boost. ![Booster Upgrade](./images/booster_upgrade.png)

Collect all parts to build the ultimate racing car and compete for exclusive rewards.


Once a player collects all the necessary NFT parts (such as body kits, engines, wheels, and boosters), they can redeem these for a real RC car. This adds an exciting real-world reward to the virtual racing experience, motivating players to engage more deeply with the game and collect all the parts.

Players can then compete against each other. When a car wins a race, its `Victories` counter increases. If it loses, the `Defeats` counter increments accordingly.
